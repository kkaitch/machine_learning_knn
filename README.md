## Project Goal
This project is to apply k-nearest neighbors and cross-validation to tackle the California median house value.

## Introduction
This project has three parts:

* Part I: Experimental Setup
* Part II: Nearest Neighbor and Cross-Validation
* Part III: Overfitting in Model Selection and Nested Cross Validation

For part I and II we will consider a regression problem. For these first two parts, we will be working with a modified version of the California Housing Dataset (cal_housing_data_clean.csv).
For part III we will consider a classification problem. We will not be using the California Housing Dataset but rather synthetic data that we generate.

## Dataset
In this project, we will be using a version of the [California Housing Prices Dataset](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/real_world.html#california-housing-dataset) with additional information.
